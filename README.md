# esphome-emoncm
ESPHome energy monitor using CT clamps and ZMPT101B

Based on https://github.com/danpeig/ESP32EnergyMonitor (thank you to @danpeig for providing some great documentation on his project!), but using the async EmonLibCM instead of EmonLib.  My hope is to this will allow running the web server alongside the sensor.
